# gembot
A simple, high-performance [Discord](https://discord.gg) bot, written in Crystal (a compiled, typed Ruby spinoff).

## Installation
Install Crystal and Shards (the package manager).

Compiling gembot is then as simple as running `make`.

## Usage
Export your bot token and client id as environment variables to `$TOKEN` and `$CLIENT_ID`,
or put them in the `.env` file, which will be loaded as well, with environment variables taking precedence.

## Development
TODO: write section.
